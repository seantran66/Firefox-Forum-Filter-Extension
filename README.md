# Firefox-Forum-Filter-Extension

This extension was inspired by a similar extension on Google Chrome. I had been using that extension, paired with an ad blocker, to improve my forum experience. When Google Chrome removed ad blockers about a year ago, I decide to make the switch to Firefox. \
\
However, there wasn't an extension out there that fit what I was looking for. Some had features that could highlight/dim posts, but all I wanted was an extension that would hide posts that are below a specified reactions threshold and aren't posted by whitelisted users. I eventually made my way back to Chrome, deciding I would just put up with the ads, as the extension on Chrome was vital to by forums experience.\
\
After a year of dealing with ads bogging down my computer, I finally decided to make my own extension. Though I only have moderate experience with HTML and little-to-no experience with JavaScript, I was able to leverage generative AI to do much of the heavy lifting in developing this extension.\
\
As such, I've decided to make the repository public, given it contains very little that couldn't be easily achieved by utilizing generative AI. Anyone who would like to improve upon this extension by using this repository as a foundation is welcome to do so.\
